Hey there, I'm Gilbert King, a data enthusiast with an insatiable love for unraveling the mysteries hidden in numbers! As a senior data analyst, I've accumulated an impressive bag of tricks, including Excel, SQL, Python, Google Analytics, and more! You can find me hanging out on LinkedIn, where I love connecting with fellow data aficionados and sharing my exciting data adventures. When I'm not diving into data, you might catch me sipping coffee, dreaming up colorful data visualizations, and having a blast with my friends.

Beyond the data world, I'm also a champion of the community. During my time at Lightship Capital, I had the incredible opportunity to help start-ups raise funds and grow, showcasing that my skills go beyond just numbers. So, if you ever need some data-driven wisdom, a great conversation over coffee, or someone to geek out about data with, I'm your friendly go-to guy! Let's connect, and together, we'll explore the fascinating world of data, one insight at a time!
