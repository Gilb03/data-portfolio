I'm a data technologist and marketing analytics expert with seven years of experience translating complex data into strategic business insights. My work spans marketing, sales, and web analytics, where I apply statistical modeling, forecasting, and machine learning techniques to optimize performance and drive growth.

I specialize in web reporting, attribution modeling, and predictive analytics—helping businesses move beyond surface-level metrics to understand causality, customer behavior, and revenue impact. From refining multi-touch attribution models to designing data pipelines for scalable reporting, I bring a rigorous analytical approach to decision-making.

Previously, as a startup founder and Lightship Capital alum, I worked closely with early-stage companies on data-driven growth strategies, fundraising analytics, and performance forecasting. Now, I consult with organizations looking to refine their marketing and sales analytics, improve their predictive models, or better leverage data for strategic planning.

If you're looking to integrate advanced analytics into your marketing strategy, optimize sales forecasting, or build a more data-driven approach to growth, let’s connect. If you're hiring, I’m always eager to collaborate on challenging problems at the intersection of data science, marketing, and business intelligence.
